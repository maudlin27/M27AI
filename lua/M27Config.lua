M27RunVeryFast = false --Game starts off at +10 speed if set to adjustable
M27StrategicLog = false --Affects the strategic overseer logs which give various stats re the AI's state during the game
M27ShowPathingGraphically = false --Will draw the pathing for land, amphibious and navy if set to true, but will make things very slow
M27RunProfiling = false --Records data on how long most functions are taking
M27ProfilingIgnoreFirst2Seconds = true --Means logic relating to pathing generation gets ignored
--M27ProfilingIgnoreFirstMin = true --Means logic relating to pathing generation gets ignored
M27RunSoftlesProfiling = false --Runs Softles profiling which tracks every function call (not just in my code but in the game) which allows calculation of the average tick length that a function occurs in (i.e. doesnt track time spent by each function but instead can use the correlation between function calls and how long a tick is taking)
