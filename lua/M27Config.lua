--Manually turn below off prior to release
M27ShowUnitNames = false --(Overseer will set this to true if game settings are to show platoon names for all as well)
M27ShowEnemyUnitNames = false --Will rename enemy units to reflect their ID and lifetime count
M27RunVeryFast = false --Game starts off at +10 speed if set to adjustable
M27StrategicLog = false --Affects the strategic overseer logs which give various stats re the AI's state during the game
M27ShowPathingGraphically = true --(also turns on log showing map name) - Will draw the pathing for land, amphibious and navy if set to true, but will make things very slow

M27AllowDebugWithMultipleHumans = false --Some options like draw circle are disabled with >1 human in the game due to desync risk.  This can be used to enable them

--Profiling options:
M27RunProfiling = false --Records data on how long most functions are taking; if setting to true part-way through game then need to also run ForkThread(M27Utilities.ProfilerActualTimePerTick)
M27ProfilingIgnoreFirst2Seconds = true --Means logic relating to pathing generation gets ignored
--M27ProfilingIgnoreFirstMin = true --Means logic relating to pathing generation gets ignored
M27RunSoftlesProfiling = false --Runs Softles profiling which tracks every function call (not just in my code but in the game) which allows calculation of the average tick length that a function occurs in (i.e. doesnt track time spent by each function but instead can use the correlation between function calls and how long a tick is taking)
M27RunGamePerformanceCheck = false --Runs regardless of whether M27 is active in the game, sends a log every second with how long it took to run that second and how many units are in the game.  Intended for August 2022 AI tourney performance profiling
